MC Server Discord Bot (Hosted privately on my RPI)

started a 1.21.1 MC server with my friends on 5/27/25 and have had many prior. thought this would be a good project for my github and also would be practical and completely self hosted. a lot of MC discord bots are limited and aren't updated very often.

this bot is NOT made to work fresh off the install. you will have to configure a '.env' file to fill in some values that i neglected to hardcode for simplicity and privacy's sake.

i am to expand the rcon capabilities of this bot in the near future and overhaul the embeds/general aesthetics of the responses.

please reach out to me on linkedin (linked.aayan.us) if you have any questions about this bot.
